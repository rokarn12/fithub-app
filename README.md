# FitHub
## Expect more from your clothes.
Repository for the development of the FitHub app
How long does it take to figure out what to wear in the morning? How many pieces of clothes do you have? Can you even estimate it? Exactly. How are you supposed to pair the perfect top with the perfect bottom, in a timely fashion, without knowing every single item in your closet or dresser? That’s why we created FitHub, a hub for all of your outfits. Our easy-to-use interface allows you to input your clothes into the virtual closet, so you don’t have to tear apart your wardrobe looking for ideas on what to wear. Our software also lets you mix and match clothes, favorite outfits, plan outfits for the week, and our exclusive color algorithm will recommend clothes that will go well with the type of event, and the rest of your fit. Don’t waste any more time cleaning up after trying on too many outfits.
